# WorldSuicideAnalysis
This is a Data Analysis project in world suicide rates are analysed based on different parameters, like GDP per Capita Income, Population, HDI index, Categories of Age Groups and corresponding generations and Sex.

[1 of the reasons, why suicides are committed all over the world?](https://medium.com/@chandiwalaaadhar/1-of-the-reasons-why-suicides-are-committed-all-over-the-world-fc447408d76e)

## Installation & Usage
- [X] Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook Installed on your Device

``` 
git clone https://github.com/chandiwalaaadhar/WorldSuicideAnalysis

git jupyter notebook 
```
  
Open Suicides.ipynb, then run all of the code tabs

## Dataset Files Included
* hdi.csv
* master.csv
master.csv is a file that contains the overall data, and hdi.csv was mined from external source URL: (http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#) to deal with the missing Values of HDI from the original dataset
## Process Used
#### CRISP-DM process is used to work on this project

## Business Questions Answered with the help of this Project
* Which Group has the Highest Suicide Rates (Based on Sex and Age Groups)?
* Which was the worst year across the world for suicide rate?
* Which countries have had the unhappiest male/females in the world?
* Does HDI & GDP per Capita of a country has an impact on suicide rates there?
## Future Implementations
Looking to Use Machine Learning Algorithm to Predit Suicide rates over the world in coming years.
